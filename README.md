# Music scales look up app
Client side app for looking up music scales

**Link to project:** https://major-music-scales-api.herokuapp.com/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node / Express, Heroku

Made front end HTML / JS myself. Created a MongoDB database with a collection of music scales. Currently only major scales, will add more as time goes on.
Attempted to deploy to Heroku seperately from the server side portion of the app. Did not work


## Optimizations

First had client side and server side in seperate files, failed to load on Heroku. Added this portion to the server side app in a public folder.

DISCONTINUED DEVELOPEMENT FOR THIS REPO - CHECK API REPO BELOW FOR UPDATED VERSION

## Lessons Learned:

Lesson 1: use public folder for client side html / JS in public folder, make one complete project
